      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Bank A’s marketing campaign, conducted primarily through phone calls, sought to increase subscriptions to its term deposits. 
        Overall, customer demographics, financial standing, and the quality of campaign interactions strongly influence subscription rates.
      </p>
      <p>Analysis of the dataset revealed the following key insights:</p>

      </figure>

      <ul>
        <li>Subscriber Composition: Only 11.52% of customers subscribed, showing strong untapped potential.</li>
        <li>Demographics: Subscriptions are concentrated in the 30–40 age group, who also hold higher average yearly balances. Clients under 30 show low subscription rates.</li>
        <li>Occupational Profile: Managers, technicians, and blue-collar workers are the main subscriber groups, suggesting campaign tailoring to specific work environments.</li>
        <li>Campaign Effectiveness: Longer calls reduce the need for follow-ups, highlighting the importance of quality over quantity in customer engagement.</li>
        <li>Clustering Insights: K-means clustering identified promising customer segments, particularly blue-collar and technician workers with secondary education and clients aged 38–43.</li>
        <li>Predictive Analytics: Decision trees and regression models showed that call duration, prior campaign outcomes, and occupation are the strongest predictors of subscription likelihood.</li>
        <li>Prescriptive Analytics: Monte Carlo simulation suggests that optimizing parameters such as call duration, campaign frequency, and personalized incentives can maximize expected subscriptions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Bank A conducted a phone-based marketing campaign to promote its term deposit products.</p>
      <p>The dataset contains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Demographics: age, marital status, employment status, etc.</li>
        <li>Bank-related data: client financial and account information.</li>
        <li>Campaign interaction details: call duration, number of calls per client.</li>
        <li>Outcome: whether the client subscribed to the term deposit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This dataset enables analysis of client characteristics, campaign effectiveness, and factors influencing subscription decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Situation</h2>
      <p>The marketing campaign mainly via phone calls aimed to boost term deposit subscriptions but resulted in varied outcomes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Complication</h2>
      <p>
        Success rate of the existing phone call approach is uncertain. Various investment options such as cryptocurrency, stock market, annuity plan, etc 
        make the bank exercise more campaigns to attract customers to consider term deposits.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Business Problem</h2>
      <p>What customer characteristics / segments contribute to a higher likelihood of subscribing to term deposits?</p>
      <p>
        Variables include demographic (age, marital status, and occupation), bank information (bank balance, housing loans, and personal loans), and campaign information (duration of calls, number of calls, and previous campaign outcomes).
      </p>
      <p>
        Assumptions include that customer demographic and financial standing remain unchanged, the external market environment stays stable, and no disruptive events such as crises or new competitors occur during the forecast period.
